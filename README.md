# Breast Cancer Detection Model

## Overview

This project presents a machine learning model designed to detect breast cancer from ultrasonic images. Leveraging the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, the model classifies the presence and type of breast cancer, contributing to early detection and diagnosis.

## Features

- **SVM-based Classification**: Utilizes the SVM algorithm to classify images based on features extracted from ultrasonic scans.
- **Ultrasonic Image Processing**: Processes and analyzes ultrasonic images to identify potential indicators of breast cancer.
- **User-friendly Web Interface**: Includes a website for awareness, updates, and information about breast cancer detection.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow/Keras (if used for additional features)
- Flask/Django (if used for the web interface)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd breast-cancer-detection
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Dataset**: Ensure your ultrasonic image dataset is formatted correctly and placed in the appropriate directory.

2. **Train the Model**:

   ```python
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. **Evaluate the Model**:

   ```python
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

4. **Run the Web Interface** (if applicable):

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the Web Interface**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or the appropriate port).
